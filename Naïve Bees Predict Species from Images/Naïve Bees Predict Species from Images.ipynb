    "# Naïve Bees: Predict Species from Images\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this project, you will use the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data, then build a model to identify honey bees and bumble bees given an image of these insects.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is the second part of a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.\n",

These bees have different [behaviors and appearances](https://www.thesca.org/connect/blog/bumblebees-vs-honeybees-what%E2%80%99s-difference-and-why-does-it-matter), but given the variety of backgrounds, positions, and image resolutions, it can be a challenge for machines to tell them apart.\n",

    "Being able to identify bee species from images is a task that ultimately would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. Pollinating bees have critical roles in both ecology and agriculture, and diseases like [colony collapse disorder](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/07/pesticide-found-in-70-percent-of-massachusetts-honey-samples/) threaten these species. Identifying different species of bees in the wild means that we can better understand the prevalence and growth of these important insects.\n",
